### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lara. I am a trained Biologist and did my PhD on rhythms in animals' acoustic signals and how to analyse them at the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin 
and the Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. 

I am currently working at the Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, Berlin and am also affiliated with the Max-Planck-Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different projects to analyse the temporal structures of communication signals, i.e. in connection to movement.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the rhythm analysis app I am programming (https://github.com/LSBurchardt/R_app_rhythm).
- ðŸ“˜ My most recent publication: Robust rhythm reporting will advance ecological and evolutionary research (https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14118)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on rhythm analysis in various time series data, i.e. heartbeat measurements or acoustic data
