### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Lara. I did my PhD on rhythms in animals' acoustic signals and how to analyse them at the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin 
and the Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. I am now working at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour at Radboud University, Nijmegen.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different projects to analyse the temporal structures of communication signals, i.e. in connection to movement.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the rhythm analysis app I am programming (https://github.com/LSBurchardt/R_app_rhythm).
- ğŸ“˜ My most recent publication: Novel ideas to further expand the applicability of rhythm analysis (https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8417)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on rhythm analysis in various time series data, i.e. heartbeat measurements or acoustic data
