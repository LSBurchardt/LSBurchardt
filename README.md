### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Lara. I am a trained Biologist and did my PhD on rhythms in animals' acoustic signals and how to analyse them at the Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin 
and the Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. 

I am currently working at the Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin, where I have my own DFG-project to develop rhythm analysis methodology further. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different projects to analyse the temporal structures of communication signals, i.e. in connection to movement.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the rhythm analysis app I am programming (https://github.com/LSBurchardt/R_app_rhythm).
- ğŸ“˜ My most recent publication: A toolkit for the dynamic study of air sacs in siamang and other elastic circular structures ([https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14118](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012222))
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on rhythm analysis in various time series data, i.e. heartbeat measurements or acoustic data
